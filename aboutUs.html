                <p>
                    Shopping is as much about the experience as it is about the things you buy. At Food Lover’s Market, we have taken this principle to heart, recreating the ambience of a fresh marketplace in a modern theatre-of-food setting. Visiting one of our stores truly is an experience like no other.

                    The group has grown to include many partners, such as Food Lover’s Eatery – a deli extension of the brand offering ready to eat meal offerings; FreshStop, the fresh convenience store; Market Liquors and Diamond Discount Liquors, our alcohol brand and Seattle Coffee Company, our coffee partner.

                    Our supplier partners include Dried Fruit for All, leaders in their industry and supplier dried fruit, fresh and roasted nuts, our famous Christmas cake mix and much more;  and FVC International – the largest importer and export of fresh produce in South Africa.

                <p>
                    The year is 1993. Brian and Mike Coppin open the first Fruit & Veg City store In Access Park, Cape Town, launching one of the most incredible success stories South Africa has seen. The brothers’ journey continues to this day, with the two of them overseeing the rapid expansion of Food Lover’s Market to every corner of the country, and beyond. Having built their company on traditional family values such as trust, honesty and integrity, they now hold the honour of being South Africa’s undisputed leaders in fresh.

                    Today, there are over 100 stores in South Africa and more in Southern Africa.
